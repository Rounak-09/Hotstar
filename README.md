# Hotstar
 
I have cloned the search functionality of Hotstar. When you type a movies name in the searchbar on the top right corner of the landing page you will start getting movie suggestions even before typing the full name of the movie. 
When you click on any of the movies from the sugesstions, the movies details will be displayed.
You can also view trending movies list by clicking on the movies tab on the top left corner of the landing page and a list of trending movies will appear before you.
Hope you enjoy the site.
